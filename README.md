# IMAGE_ROTATION

# INTRODUCTION

This project is based on image processing in C++ using openCV.Image is represented in a form of a matrix.This program will read an image and also input an angle with the direction
and rotate the image by the given angle in the given direction.

# LIBRARY USED-OPENCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision,machine learning, and image processing.

# LANGUAGE USED

C++
